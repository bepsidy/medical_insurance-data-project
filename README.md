# medical insurance data science foundations project

Although the prompt for this project and the dataset was provided by Codecademy in the Data Science Foundations course, I wrote all the questions and found the solutions to each question myself using Python 3 in Jupyter Notebook.

The ipynb file can be opened in Jupyter Notebook. If you don't have Jupyter Notebook, open the .html version to check out my project. 

Thank you!
